# CAC Automation and Visualization Platform
This project focuses on building a data-driven analytical tool designed to automate the calculation and analysis of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for businesses. Leveraging the power of Python, with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive visualizations, the tool enables efficient, scalable, and accurate CAC computations. To enhance visual interpretation, the project integrates with Tableau, providing customized dashboards that offer clear, actionable insights into customer acquisition performance across different channels and time periods.

 The project's primary objective is to deliver deeper insights through customized reporting and analytics, enabling businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and financial management.
